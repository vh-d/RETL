# RETL

`RETL` is an R package that provides tools for writing ETL jobs in R. It
stands on Râ€™s wide range of APIs to various types of data sources.

It is intended to be used together with the
*[Rflow](https://github.com/vh-d/Rflow)* and
*[RETLflow](https://github.com/vh-d/RETLflow)* packages as universal API
to data stored in databases, files, excel sheets. RETL relies heavily on
the `data.table` package for fast data transofrmations.

## Installation

RETL can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/vh-d/RETL) by
running:

``` r
devtools::install_github("vh-d/RETL")
```

## Examples

``` r
library(RETL)
library(magrittr)

# establish connections
my_db    <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "path/to/my.db")
your_csv <- "path/to/your.csv"
your_db  <- dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(), group = "your-db")
```

### Pipes

``` r
# simple extract and load
etl_read(from = your_csv) %>% etl_write(to = my_db, name = "customers")

# extract -> transform -> load
etl_read(from = my_db, name = "orders") %>% # extract from a database
  dbq(, order_year := year(order_date)) %>% # transform (adding a new column)
  etl_write(to = your_db, name = "customers") # load
```

### Other tools

``` r
set_index(table = "customers", c("id", "order_year"), your_db)
```
